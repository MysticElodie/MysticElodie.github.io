		<h2>Morrowind Visual Masterguide</h2>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>While it's tempting to jump right in and start downloading mods, PLEASE read these introductory notes first, especially if you're new to Morrowind or Mod Organizer 2.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>This guide assumes that you own a legal copy of Morrowind's basegame and its expansions. This means you should have either the official discs, or one of the many official digital releases.
				<ul>
					<li>Additionally, the guide is designed for players using the original engine. Some of the mods and programs used won't work correctly (or at all) with OpenMW.
				</ul>
			<li>It's always worth looking at a mod's description page (if it has one) before downloading it! Though this guide should cover everything you need to install each mod, it's best to know what you're installing.
			<li>The guide is designed with Mod Organizer 2 in mind. MO2 has official support for Morrowind, and in my opinion, it's the most convinient tool you can use for mod management. MO2 has a lot of different functions, and generally I'm not going to go too in-depth about how each one works. If you're coming to Morrowind from newer Bethesda games, there's a good chance you're already familiar with the program. If not, GamerPoets has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruq6hQIAvB8&list=PLlN8weLk86Xh3ue76x2ibqtmMramwQmHB">great set of videos</a> on installing and using it, if you're confused about anything.
				<ul>
					<li>For many mods, MO2 will <a href="https://youtu.be/LwaC7gP7_JM?t=358">require you to point to a data directory folder when installing</a>. Unless I specify otherwise in the guide, the data directory folder will always be the <code>Data Files</code> folder.
					<li>Some mods in this guide will need to be installed multiple times, or multiple files will need to be downloaded from a single mod page. When this happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/LwaC7gP7_JM?t=397">make sure to either merge or rename the mod</a> unless you're fully reinstalling it.
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Installation</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>You'll want to start with a new installation of the game. Preferably, you want to make sure that it's installed outside of the Program Files folder to prevent issues; if you're playing the Steam version, <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129">this page</a> will show you how to change your install location for games, if you need to.
			<li>If you're playing any GOTY release of the game, then you already have the newest official patches. If you're playing on original disc releases, you can find the official patches for the game and its expansions towards the bottom of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190818065658/https://patches.bethsoft.com/">this page</a>.
			<li>Before we do anything else, launch the game once to make sure everything is correctly installed. You don't have to go any further than the title screen.
		</ul>

		<h3>External Tools</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510">Morrowind Code Patch</a> - This program patches many bugs in Morrowind's program. Manually download the main file, extract it into the game's main folder (The <code>Morrowind</code> folder, not <code>Data Files</code>) and run it.
				<ul>
					<li>MCP's most essential options are all checked by default, but I'd recommend looking through the other options too; a lot of them are very welcome changes. Some noteworthy examples;
						<ul>
							<li><code>Swift casting</code> allows you to cast spells much more efficiently, and do so while holding a weapon.
							<li><code>Argonian clothing choice</code> makes female Argonians use male meshes for armor and clothing, since they don't have defined breasts.
							<li><code>Hi-def cutscene support</code> is required by some of the mods in this guide.
							<li><code>Map expansion (for Tamriel Rebuilt)</code> is essential for TR users, zooming out the map so that all of the mainland is visible.
							<li><code>Shortcut key improvements</code> offers many fixes and improvements for keyboard shortcuts.
							<li><code>Better typography</code> improves the interfaces for books, scrolls, and the quest journal.
						</ul>
					<li>When you're done, click <code>Apply chosen patches</code> and then close the program.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102">MGE XE</a> - This program's primary focus is visual improvements such as shaders and distant terrain. Manually download the <code>MGE XE Manual Install</code> file
				<ul>
					<li>Due to how MO2 works, we'll need to run MGE XE and several other programs through it. MO2 should automatically detect <code>MGEXEgui.exe</code> and add it to the executables list, but if not, you can <a href="https://youtu.be/mqjzxQ7D-ZQ?t=248">add it yourself</a>. Once it's added, launch the program via MO2.
					<li>We won't be changing most of MGE XE's settings until the end of the guide, but there's a few things we can do now.
						<ul>
							<li>On the Graphics tab, choose your preferred settings for resolution, windowed mode, antialiasing, etc. If "Auto FOV" isn't enabled by default, I recommend checking it. For now, don't enable shaders.
							<li>Skip over the Distant Land tab entirely for now, and go to the In-Game tab. By default, "Skip Opening Movie" is checked. If you want the Bethesda logo to display on startup, you can uncheck it. "Crosshair Autohide" is a nice change, hiding the crosshair when it isn't needed.
							<li>Still on the In-Game tab, change the Dynamic lighting coefficients to the following. This is the last thing we'll need to change in MGE XE for now;
								<ul>
									<li>Quadratic 2.619
									<li>Linear 1.0
									<li>Constant 0.382
								</ul>
						</ul>
					<li>Once you're done changing MGE XE's settings, you can close the program. Additionally, run the <code>MWSE-Update.exe</code> that came with it (you don't have to add it as an MO2 executable, just run it normally from the game's folder) to ensure you have the newest version of the Morrowind Script Extender installed.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/mlox/mlox/releases/tag/v1.0">mlox</a> - mlox is Morrowind's equivalent to load order sorting tools such as LOOT. Download the <code>mlox.exe</code> file, and move it into your main game folder. Then, you'll need to <a href="https://youtu.be/mqjzxQ7D-ZQ?t=248">add it to MO2</a>.
				<ul>
					<li>After adding it, launch mlox from MO2 to make sure it launches properly. You shouldn't need to update your load order at this point, so you can just exit the program once it's finished loading.
					<li>After launching the program to setup its files, you'll want to update the base file. In most cases, this will be <code>C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\mlox\mlox</code>. Once you find it, replace <code>mlox_base.txt</code> with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yooksi/mlox/master/data/mlox_base.txt">the newest version</a>.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45439">Wrye Mash - Polemos Fork</a> - Similar to Wrye Bash for newer Bethesda games, this tool provides a lot of useful functionality for modded installations of Morrowind. Download the <code>Wrye Mash 2019 - x64 - manual installation archive</code> file, and extract it into the game's main folder.
				<ul>
					<li>Before we can add Wrye Mash to MO2, we need to run it normally. Run <code>mash64.exe</code> in the <code>Mopy</code> folder, and click through the config wizard.
						<ul>
							<li>For the first entry, navigate to your main game folder.
							<li>The second entry's location doesn't matter; it's intended for anyone using Wrye Mash as a mod manager, which we aren't in this guide. (I just created a "Mods" folder within my main Morrowind folder for it).
							<li>For the Mlox directory option, select your <code>Mlox.exe</code> file.
						</ul>
					<li>You can keep the rest of the settings the same and finish setup, and then close Wrye Mash once it opens. Add Wrye Mash as an MO2 executable by adding the <code>mash64.exe</code>, and we're done with it for now.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/john-moonsugar/tes3cmd/releases/tag/v0.40-pre-release-2">tes3cmd</a> - A program used for cleaning dirty mod files for Morrowind. Download the <code>tes3cmd.exe</code> file and place it into your Morrowind's <code>Data Files</code> folder. That's all we need to do with it for now.
		</ul>

		<h2>Essential Mods</h2>

		<h3>Patches & Bug Fixes</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096">Patch for Purists</a> - An unofficial patch for Morrowind, similar to the Unofficial Patches for future Bethesda games. Fixes a ton of issues all throughout the game.
			<li><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-10353">Texture Fix</a> - Fixes many landscape texture seams throughout Vvardenfell.
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46018">Texture Fix - Extended</a> - Additional fixes for the above mod. Only check the <code>Main File</code> during installation.
			<li><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-90-10388">Texture Fix - Bloodmoon</a> - Similar to the above mods, fixes many landscape seams on Solstheim. Skip this if you plan on using Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince (see the Major Mods section).
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634">Expeditious Exit</a> - Fixes a common crash that can occur when trying to exit the game, especially with modded installations.
		</ul>

		<h3>Official Plugins</h3>

		<p>Bethesda developed several official plugins for Morrowind following its release. <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Plugins">Information on these plugins can be found here</a>. Unfortunately, many of these came with issues, so we won't be using the original versions.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43931">Unofficial Morrowind Official Plugins Patched</a> - This mod project includes the official plugins with many bugs fixed. You’re free to mix and match any of these; if there are any you don’t want to use, you can hide/delete their ESP files.
				<ul>
					<li>First, download and install the main <code>UMOPP 3.0.3</code> file.
					<li>Next, download the <code>Merged and Compatibility Versions</code> file. What you install from here depends on which plugins you want to use.
						<ul>
							<li>If you plan on using all of the official plugins, only check <code>UMOPP Better Armor Merged</code>. After installing, hide/delete all of the .esp files from the <code>UMOPP 3.0.3</code> main file.
							<li>If you only want to use some of the official plugins, only check <code>UMOPP Compatibility</code>. After installing, hide/delete all of the .esp files for plugins you don't want from both the main file and the compatibility versions file.
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46364">Pika's Miscellaneous Mods</a> - Download the <code>UMOPP Misc Mods and AddOns</code> file. Enhancements for several of the official plugins and an improved script, respectively.
				<ul>
					<li>Install <code>UMOPP Misc Mods and AddOns</code> first. Which options you check during installation depends on which official plugins you're using;
						<ul>
							<li>If you're using Adamantium Armor, check <code>Adamantium Pauldrons Enchant Fix</code>.
							<li>If you're using Bitter Coast Sounds, check <code>Better Dragonfly Texture</code> and optionally, <code>Silent BCSounds</code> if you don't want the ambient sounds added by that plugin.
							<li>If you're using Master Index, check <code>Better Master Index Mesh</code>.
							<li>If using Siege at Firemoth, check <code>Grurn the Lich Sounds</code>.
							<li>If using LeFemm Armor, check <code>Sirollus Saccus Training Fix</code>.
						</ul>
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Lighting</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/39605">True Lights and Darkness</a> - Overhauls Morrowind's lighting, making interior lights appear much more realistic. Optional, as some may find these lighting changes too dark (you'll need a light to navigate some dungeons).
				<ul>
					<li>Hide/delete <code>Mudcrab Island TLAD.esp</code> and <code>True_Lights_And_Darkness_1.0-NoDaylight.esp</code> after installing.
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Major Mods</h3>

		<p>Before we install any more mods, there's several notable mods that I'm going to list now as there'll be some patches or special instructions for them throughout the rest of the guide. These are all optional; it's up to you whether or not you want to use them.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145">Tamriel Rebuilt</a> - A massive fan project that aims to design and implement the entirety of Morrowind's mainland into the game. Still a work-in-progress, but already includes a completed area <a href="https://twitter.com/TamrielRebuilt/status/1131657783005327370">rivalling the size of TES IV's Cyrodiil</a>.
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537">Tamriel Data</a> - A large asset repository required by Tamriel Rebuilt. Download the HD version.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46810">Vvardenfell and Solstheim Worldspace Remaster</a> - Currently, this mod primarily features <code>Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince</code>, a complete landscape overhaul of the island of Solstheim from Morrowind's Bloodmoon expansion. Don't download this mod yet if you want to use it; we'll be installing it later in the guide anyway. For now, just keep it in mind, as some mods will have seperate installation instructions for STotSP compatibility (including <code>Texture Fix - Bloodmoon</code> earlier in the guide).
		</ul>

		<h2>Base Retextures</h2>

		<h3>Intelligent Textures</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47469">Intelligent Textures</a> - Before we install any more replacers, you'll want to install this as our base texture replacer. Upscales nearly every texture in the game. A lot of this will be replaced by better replacers later down the line, but it’s a solid base for everything that isn’t touched by other mods.
		</ul>

		<h3>Connary's Textures</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-5740">Connary's Landscapes - Grazelands</a> - A retexture set for landscapes and flora in the Grazelands region.
			<li><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-56-15572">Connary's Landscapes - West Gash</a> - A retexture set for landscapes and flora in the West Gash region.
			<li><a href="http://mw.modhistory.com/download-42-5745">Connary's Wood Furniture</a> - A retexture set for many wooden object textures.
		</ul>

		<h2>User Interface & Cinematics</h2>

		<h3>User Interface</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43922">Morrowind UI Revamped</a> - Revamps the vanilla user interface in HD. Choose the options that look best to you in the installer. I recommend the 50% smaller crosshair and 25% smaller cursor, but you can try out the options for yourself and find what works best for you.
				<ul>
					<li>You'll need to make some changes to your Morrowind.ini for this mod's text colors to work. Open MO2's ini editor (the puzzle pieces in the top left) and copy the following changes;
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16Ae4zTeEQA4w_Wx9nfW0UPStuPMiwcDA">Classic theme</a>
							<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17h0XxXNz53WVX_fmoLg1pjrxrjEdZ-ZE">Dark theme</a>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45982">Consistent Main Menus</a> - New textures for the menu options. Only download one file, I recommend one of the Pelagiad options;
				<ul>
					<li><code>Daedrish</code> is flat white text in a font that looks similar to Daedric text. <code>Pelagiad</code> is flat white text in a font that looks similar to vanilla's font. <code>Pelagiad OG</code> is yellow text in a font and style that looks most similar to vanilla.
					<li>No matter which option you choose, when installing, check <code>Core Menu</code>, <code>MWSE MCM</code>, and if you're interested in the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45952">Continue</a> mod, <code>Petetehgoat's Continue</code>.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36873">Better Dialogue Font</a> - Replaces Morrowind’s primary font, Magic Cards, with a much clearer version.
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44540">Better Daedric Font</a> - Replaces the Daedric font used on spell scrolls with a much clearer version.
				<ul>
					<li>When installing, create a dirctory (right click on <code>&lt;data&gt;</code>) named <code>Fonts</code>.
						<ul>
							<li>For a vanilla-friendly replacer (doesn't include X and Y characters), drag <code>daedric_font.fnt</code> into the <code>Fonts</code> directory, and click OK.
							<li>For a replacer that includes the X and Y characters introduced in Oblivion, drag <code>daedric_font Standard+XY.fnt</code> into the <code>Fonts</code> directory, and click OK. Then, rename that file <code>daedric_font.fnt</code>.
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/36948">Ultimate Icon Replacer</a> - Replaces all item inventory icons with better ones. Only download the <code>Ultimate Icon Replacer v1</code> file.
		</ul>

		<h3>Menu Screens</h3>

		<p>We have a lot of options for replacing the main menu and splash screens. You can either opt for a single replacer that changes both, or get seperate replacers for each.</p>
		<p>By default, mods that add new splash screens will not stop the vanilla ones from appearing. To fix this, go to your Morrowind installation's <code>Data Files</code> folder and delete the <code>Splash</code> folder.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Main Menu only:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43657">Title Screen and Logo Video Intro Reworked</a> - Vanilla-friendly replacer, essentially just a higher resolution vanilla main menu.
						<ul>
							<li>Download the <code>Title Screen Reworked</code> file for your aspect ratio. If you don't have the opening videos disabled in MGE XE, you can also download the <code>Logo Video Intro Reworked</code> file for your aspect ratio.
						</ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47164">Widescreen Menu and Logo Replacer</a> - Vanilla-friendly replacer, featuring the logos of both of Morrowind's expansions.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43923">2015 Main Menu Background Replacers</a> - Two options for new main menu art. The first image is the main file, the second image is listed under old files.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43341">Animated Main Menu for Morrowind</a> - This one is distinct, because it’s animated rather than a static image. The downside is that it’s a MUCH larger file (around 300MB) as a result.
				</ul>
			<li>Splash Screens only:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43603">Concept Art Based Loading Screens</a> - Splash screens featuring Morrowind concept art. Best matches the main menu from <code>Title Screen and Logo Video Intro Reworked</code>.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47163">Widescreen Splash Replacer</a> - Vanilla-friendly replacer, simply the original splash screen art updated in HD. Best matches the main menu from <code>Widescreen Menu and Logo Replacer</code>.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47211">RFD's Splash Screens</a> - Simple splash screens with art on a paper background. Download any or all of the 3 files.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47211">Splash Races - Widescreen</a> - Simple black splash screens with official renders.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44364">Morrowloading</a> - Splash screens with flavor text, similar to Oblivion. Download both the main file and the fix.
				</ul>
			<li>Replacements for both:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43081">HD Concept-art splash screen and main menu</a> - Similar to vanilla in style, with colored concept art for splash screens. Note that the splash screens in this replacer have text in Russian rather than English.
				</ul>
		</ul>
			
		<h3>Cinematics</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43923">2015 Main Menu Background Replacers</a> - If you're using any main menu replacer that isn't <code>Title Screen and Logo Video Intro Reworked</code> or <code>Widescreen Menu and Logo Replacer</code>, and you don't have the opening videos disabled in MGE XE, you’ll want to download the <code>Menu Intro Animation Remover</code> file from here.
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42352">Morrowind Bethesda logo HD makeover</a> - HD version of the Bethesda logo intro. Don’t bother with this if you have the opening videos disabled.
				<ul>
					<li>When installing, create a directory named <code>Video</code>, and drag one of the <code>bethesda logo.bik</code> files into it. The one in the <code>Nostalgia version</code> folder simply uses the original sound instead of a remade one.
					<li>After installing, you can delete the version of the video that isn't in the <code>Video</code> folder.
				</ul>
			<li>There's two options to replace the introduction cutscene.
				<ol>
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/39329">HD Intro Cinematic</a> - HD recreation of the intro cutscene. Download the correct version for your aspect ratio. After installing, rename the .bik file to <code>mw_intro.bik</code>.
					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46411">The Role They Were to Play</a> - This replacer changes the wording of the intro cutscene to refer to the player with gender neutral terms. However, it's in the vanilla resolution.
				</ol>
		</ul>

		<h2>Mesh Fixes & Improvements</h2>

		<h3>General Mesh Replacers</h3>

		<ul>

		<h3>Glow in the Dahrk</h3>

		<p>This isn't strictly a mesh replacer, but it has to be installed between the above and below sections to prevent issues.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886">Glow in the Dahrk</a> - A fantastic mod that makes windows glow during the night, along with other enhancements. There are several options when installing:
				<ul>
					<li>Check <code>Core</code> and <code>Hi Res Window Texture Replacer</code>.
					<li>If you want sunrays to shine through windows during the day, check <code>Interior Sunrays</code>.
					<li>If you want the closed-off Nordic windows to be replaced with glass windows, check <code>Nord Glass Windows</code> and optionally <code>Nord Glass Windows Interior Sunrays</code>.
					<li>If you want windows to be added to Telvanni structures, check <code>Telvanni Dormers on Vvardenfell</code>.
						<ul>
								<li>If you choose this option, it will install three .esp files; you don't need all three. I recommend keeping the merged <code>GITD_Telvanni_Dormers.ESP</code> file and hiding/deleting the other two.
						</ul>
					<li>If you want the closed-off windows in Raven Rock to be replaced with glass windows, check <code>Raven Rock Glass Windows</code> and optionally <code>Raven Rock Glass Windows Interior Sunrays</code>.
					<li>If you're using Tamriel Rebuilt, check <code>Tamriel Rebuilt Patch</code> and optionally <code>Tamriel Rebuilt Patch Interior Sunrays</code>.
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Project Atlas</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45399">Project Atlas</a> - Project Atlas replaces many of Morrowind's meshes with versions that use atlased textures, which can provide a significant FPS boost in certain areas. Download the main file. When installing, check the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Core
					<li>BC Mushrooms - Smoothed
					<li>BC Mushrooms - Smoothed - Glowing Bitter Coast Patch
					<li>Redware - Smoothed

		<h3>Graphic Herbalism</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46599">Graphic Herbalism - MWSE and OpenMW Edition</a> - Optional, but highly recommended. In vanilla Morrowind, all harvestable plants are containers; when you interact with them, the container menu opens and you can take the ingredients. Graphic Herbalism overhauls this system by making it so that interacting with a plant immediately picks it, and the plant's appearance changes to reflect that it has been picked; similar to Skyrim.
				<ul>
					<li>Download the main file, and if you're using Tamriel Rebuilt, also download <code>GH TR - PT Meshes</code>.
					<li>Check <code>Core + Vanilla Meshes</code> and <code>Optional - Smoothed Meshes</code> during installation.
				</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Trees</h3>

		<p>For starters, you'll want to grab all of the following:</p>

						<ul>

					<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45805">Mournhold Flora Redux</a> - The more vanilla friendly option. Only download the main MFR - Trees file.
				</ol>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/37856">Vurt's Solstheim Tree Replacer II</a> - You only need this if you AREN'T planning on using Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince, or if you ARE using a mod that makes use of the default Solstheim trees, such as Tamriel Rebuilt. Otherwise, you can skip it. Download the main file and the collision fix, install the main file first.

		<p>First, we'll want to download a groundcover mod, as they function through MGE XE's distant land system. There's two options for groundcover that I can recommend, compare the two and choose one.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46733">Remiros' Groundcover</a> - Includes rocks and mushrooms along with grass. Grasses are lush, but not very tall, making sure they're easy to see through. Grasses have been removed from certain areas of the landscape where they might cause issues or look off. More mod support out-of-the-box than Aesthesia. Download the main <code>Remiros' Groundcover</code> file.
				<ul>
					<li>When installing, check <code>Core</code>. If you're using Tamriel Rebuilt, check <code>TR Plugins</code> and <code>TR Preview Plugins</code> if you're playing with TR's preview plugin enabled.
					<li>If you don't like the mushrooms added by this mod, you can check <code>No Mushrooms</code>.
					<li>For grass that appears more dense, check <code>Thicker Grass</code>.
					<li>If you're using <code>Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince</code>, hide/delete <code>Rem_Solstheim.esp</code>. The Vvardenfell and Solstheim Worldspace Remaster installer includes a patch for Remiros' Groundcover; just run the installer again and check <code>Remiros' Groundcover for S-TOTSP</code>.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46377">Aesthesia Groundcover</a> - Includes ferns, flowers, and other plants along with grass. Grasses are lush, often very tall, and cover the entire landscape. Less compatible out-of-the-box with some mods. Download the main file.
				<ul>
					<li>After installing, open the mod's files. Move <code>Grass Vanilla 1.esp</code> and <code>Grass Vanilla 2.esp</code> from the <code>Grass Vanilla</code> folder into the mod's main folder. If you AREN'T using <code>Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince</code>, you can also do this for <code>Grass Bloodmoon.esp</code> 
					<li>If you're using Tamriel Rebuilt, move all of the files from the <code>Grass TR</code> folder into the mod's main folder. Do the same for the <code>Grass TR preview</code> folder if you're playing with TR's preview plugin enabled.
				</ul>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/31051">Vurt's Groundcover</a> - Optional, if you want corals to be added underwater in some areas. Don't download the main file, only the <code>Vurts Corals</code> optional file.
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/43255">Distant Mournhold</a> - Allows you to see Mournhold's taller buildings from any part of the city.

		</ul>

		<p>If you need to generate new groundcover files (for example, if you want to use Aesthesia's grass with <code>Solstheim Tomb of the Snow Prince</code>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46377">the Aesthesia mod page</a> has a short guide on how to do so towards the bottom.</p>
		<p>Now if you look at your plugins, you'll notice that the groundcover mods add... Quite a few .esp files. We don't actually want any of these plugins to be enabled in-game, so you should disable all of them (including Vurts Corals, if you're using it). Don't hide or delete the files, just uncheck them from MO2's <code>Plugins</code> tab.</p>

		<p>Once you've done that, launch MGE XE and navigate to the Distant Land tab. Click <code>Distant land generator wizard</code> to begin the process.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On the first window that pops up, click <code>Use current load order</code>. Then, find your Groundcover mod .esp files that we disabled in MO2 and check all of them as well. Click continue.
				<li>On the next few windows, only change the settings if you think you need to; I would for the most part recommend keeping them at their defaults when you first run the program, and fine-tuning them later if you want to make your game look or run slightly better.
			</ul>

		<p>Once you've finished generating distant land, you'll be able to modify a lot of options on MGE's Distant Land tab. Much like with distant land settings, I'd recommend mostly leaving these alone at first and seeing how you're game runs with the default settings before adjusting them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Draw distance adjusts how far you're able to see. I recommend a value somewhere between 5 and 15 cells.
				<li>Dynamic ripples adds natural waves to the water. If you enable them, I recommend setting the height to 40.
				<li>The Per-pixel lighting shader offers better dynamic lighting, with the expense being an often heavy FPS loss.
					<ul>
						<li>If you decide to play with per-pixel lighting enabled, you'll want to download the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42306">Negative Lights Remover mod from here</a>.
					</ul>
				<li>High quality exponential fog and High quality atmosphere & distance coloring will make distant fog appear much more realistic, but can also reduce FPS somewhat.
			</ul>

		<p>Note that generated distant land won't update automatically; if you install a new mod that makes any changes to the landscape or structures, you'll need to generate it again.</p>
		<p>One last note: if you want to speed up distant land generation a bit in the future, you can download the <a href="https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371">4GB Patch</a> and use it on <code>MGEXEgui.exe</code>.

		<h3>Shaders</h3>

		<p>First, we'll want to download some shaders that aren't included in MGE XE. This section can get pretty complicated, so bare with it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45432">Enhanced Water Shader for MGE XE</a> - Download only one file. <code>Green-Blue Water</code> gives water a somewhat green tint, whereas <code>Blue Water</code> keeps it purely blue.
				<ul>
					<li>When installing, you'll have two folders that each contain a <code>data files</code> directory. Use the one in the <code>without Sewer Waves</code> folder.
					<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JITQA1t5yGnzudGm3gF2gRIkCf7grjxa">Water Shader Fixes</a> - Updated fixes for the above shaders. Only check one option when installing.
				</ul>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381217735306248192/609149467962376224/EdgeAA.zip">EdgeAA</a> - A shader that emulates Antialiasing effects, best used alongside MGE's existing AA options. Made by Vtastek.
		</ul>

		<p>Next, we'll download some more of Vtastek's shaders released on the MMC Discord. These won't be installed with MO2, we need to add them manually. Download both of them first.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381217735306248192/587447644876439572/deband_fogaware.fx">Deband Fogaware</a>
			<li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381217735306248192/609153055186747402/Fog-linked_DoF.fx">Fog-linked DoF</a>
		</ul>
		<p>After downloading, move both .fx files into the <code>Morrowind\Data Files\shaders\XEshaders</code> folder.</p>

		<p>Now, go back to MO2 and launch MGE XE. Check the <code>Enable shaders</code> option, and click <code>Shader setup</code>. Once it opens, click the <code>Modding</code> button at the bottom.
			<ul>
				<li>First, click <code>Clear</code> to remove all active shaders.
				<li>Now, add these shaders (by double clicking them in the <code>Avaliable shaders</code> section) in the following order:
					<ul>
						<li>SSAO HQ
						<li>Underwater Effects
						<li>Underwater Interior Effects
						<li>Sunshafts
						<li>Fog-linked_DoF
						<li>deband_fogaware
						<li>Bloom Soft
						<li>EdgeAA
						<li>Eye Adaptation (HDR)
					</ul>
				<li>Once you're done, simply click <code>Save</code>.
			</ul>

		<h3>mlox</h3>

		<p>Since we're done installing mods for now, go ahead and launch mlox from MO2. You'll most likely have messages about missing Better Bodies or Robert's Bodies- you can safely ignore these. Just click <code>Update Load Order</code> and then exit the program.</p>
		<p>Generally, it's a good idea to run mlox like this every time you install new mods before you play the game. It won't always have any changes to make, but it's best to check anyway.

		<h3>Wrye Mash</h3>

		<p>Next, we'll launch Wrye Mash and go through several of its features.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you've launched the game at any point during this guide, you may have gotten an error on startup reading <code>"One or more plugins could not find the correct versions of the master files they depend on."</code> This is usually due to mods being built on versions of the official master files that are dated differently than the ones you have installed, and it can be easily corrected with Wrye Mash.
					<ul>
						<li>If you look at your mod list on Wrye Mash's Mods tab, you'll notice that most mods have a green check box next to them while some have a yellow or orange one.
						<li>Click on a mod with an orange or yellow check box, and then click any of the master files listed in the lower right. Wrye Mash will ask if you want to edit/update the masters list. Click Yes, and then click the Save button below the masters list.
						<li>Repeat this process for any offending mods until all of the boxes are green.
					</ul>
				<li>Next, we'll create a Multipatch. This is similar to the Bashed Patch for newer Bethesda games.
					<ul>
						<li>Click <code>Misc</code> at the top of the program, then <code>TES3cmd</code> > <code>Create MultiPatch</code>.
						<li>The created patch won't have much in it right now, since we've mostly installed mods that only affect graphics. Like mlox, though, it's a good idea to remake your multipatch everytime you install new mods to prevent possible conflicts.
					</ul>
			</ul>
